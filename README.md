## Analysis Tools Used

### SonarQube
- Used for static code analysis
- Identifies code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities
- Measures code quality metrics
- Tracks technical debt

### Other Analysis Tools
- Code coverage analysis
- Static code analysis
- Code complexity metrics
- Dependency analysis

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Ant
- SonarQube Server
- SQLite Database

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up SonarQube server
3. Configure database:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 hotel.sqlite < data.sql
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ant build
   ```

## Code Analysis Process

### SonarQube Analysis
1. Run SonarQube scanner:
   ```bash
   sonar-scanner
   ```
2. Review analysis results in SonarQube dashboard
3. Address identified issues
4. Track improvements over time

### Code Quality Metrics
- Code coverage
- Code duplication
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Maintainability index
- Technical debt

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. Code review and refactoring
2. Bug fixes and patches
3. Performance optimization
4. Security updates
5. Documentation updates

### Best Practices
- Follow coding standards
- Write unit tests
- Document code changes
- Regular code reviews
- Continuous integration

## Project Goals
- Improve code quality
- Reduce technical debt
- Enhance maintainability
- Optimize performance
- Ensure security
